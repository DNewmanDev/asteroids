- **Collision Detection**: Efficient circle-based collision using distance formulas
- **Boundary Wrapping**: Screen edge teleportation for seamless gameplay

### Sprite Management
- **Pygame Sprite Groups**: Efficient organization and batch operations on game objects
- **Factory Pattern**: `AsteroidField` manages procedural asteroid spawning
- **State Management**: Game object lifecycle through sprite group membership

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Modern Python with object-oriented programming
- **Pygame 2.6.1**: Cross-platform game development framework
- **Vector Mathematics**: 2D vector operations for physics simulation
- **Sprite System**: Efficient game object management and rendering

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Object-Oriented Design
```python
class CircleShape(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """Base class for all circular game objects"""
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius):
        self.position = pygame.Vector2(x, y)
        self.velocity = pygame.Vector2(0, 0)
        self.radius = radius
    
    def collision_check(self, other):
        """Circle-to-circle collision detection"""
        distance = self.position.distance_to(other.position)
        return distance <= (self.radius + other.radius)
```

### Physics Implementation
```python
class Player(CircleShape):
    def update(self, dt):
        """Update player position with physics simulation"""
        # Apply rotation
        self.rotation += self.turn_speed * dt
        
        # Apply thrust with vector mathematics
        if thrust_input:
            thrust = pygame.Vector2(0, 1).rotate(self.rotation)
            self.velocity += thrust * PLAYER_THRUST_SPEED * dt
        
        # Update position with momentum
        self.position += self.velocity * dt
        
        # Screen wrapping
        self.wrap_position()
```

### Dynamic Asteroid System
```python
class AsteroidField:
    """Manages procedural asteroid spawning"""
    def spawn_asteroid(self, position, velocity, size):
        asteroid = Asteroid(position.x, position.y, size)
        asteroid.velocity = velocity
        
        # Split into smaller asteroids when destroyed
        if size > ASTEROID_MIN_SIZE:
            return self.split_asteroid(asteroid)
```

### Collision System
```python
# Efficient collision detection using sprite groups
for asteroid in asteroids:
    if player.collision_check(asteroid):
        # Handle player-asteroid collision
        
    for shot in shots:
        if shot.collision_check(asteroid):
            # Handle shot-asteroid collision
            # Split asteroid if large enough
```
